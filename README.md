# cs50-finance
This is my version of the "Finance" pset from the 2019 CS50x course. This was finished in Fall 2020.

The whole problem set description includung requirements can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/9/finance/

## Setup
To run locally:

Download DB file from distribution code:
```$ wget http://cdn.cs50.net/2020/fall/psets/9/finance/finance.zip```
(Remove all other files, except maybe helpers.py and requiremtents.txt)

Place ``finance.db`` into your project directory.

In a terminal in your project directory, set environmental variable for flask app:
``$ export FLASK_APP=application``

An API KEy from IEX is required (see linked description above). Set it via: ``$ export API_KEY=<YOURKEY>``
